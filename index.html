                What are cellular automaton? They are alive. One common example is Conways Game of
                life. Today we will however be looking at elemnentary cellular automaton. These
                simple cellural automata work with rows of off an on states, which can also be
                represented as binary ones and zeroes.

                One dimensional cellular automata commonly work in the following algorithm:
                (maybe counterintuitevly momajg)
                <ol>
                    <li>First, define a starting row. This is commonly just a single 1</li>
                    <li>next</li>
                </ol>
